            <p>I am Aina Jed Yosores, a 4th year BS Computer Engineering Student
                at the Western Institute of Technology. My goal in life is to be successful
                and make my parents and myself proud by achieving my dreams.

                I conceptualized and gave ideas on how the webpage should be designed
                by gathering ideas from various webpages, and searched for Youtube links,and
                blogs that can help with our project

                <h5>Developer & Designer</h5>
                <p>I am John Jerry Nathaniel P. Tono, a 4th year BS Computer Engineering Student
                    at the Western Institute of Technology. My dream is to be a successful Full Stack Web Developer
                    creating start up companies with the goal of helping the youth to be more
                    dream-oriented.
    
                    I brainstormed on the database model, and how to connect the webpage to the database.
                    It was challenging at first, but as we get the hang of it, we can do webpages faster.
                    Our greatest challenge was when our first webpage folder corrupted, and we have to start again in order to save time.
